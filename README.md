# UFO Eyewitness Reports
I have used javascript, css, and HTML with bootstrap and d3.js libraries to build a website that allows you to interact with UFO eyewitness reports. You are able to filter the reports you want to view using a number of different fields.  

## Results
This website can easily be used to research UFO sightings in your area or in around a specific date that you are curious about.  As you add more items to the filters the selection on the right will narrow to fit our inquiry.  This is usefull if you wish to look broadly then narrow down your search to a specific date or location.   

  - You can filter the page by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

  - You will note as we change the values in the filter fields the information that is displayed will change as well.s

   - Now when we enter the date 1/7/2010, you can see that the out put's the righ have changed.

   - Going further you can now filter by the exact state you want to look at.

## Summary

One draw back of this design is that you need to refresh the page to clear the filters.  It would be nice to have a "Clear Filter" button added to the selection menu.  It would also be helpful to have more information to search.
